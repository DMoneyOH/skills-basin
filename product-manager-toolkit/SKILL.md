## Core Workflows

### Feature Prioritization Process

```
Gather → Score → Analyze → Plan → Validate → Execute
```

#### Step 1: Gather Feature Requests
- Customer feedback (support tickets, interviews)
- Sales requests (CRM pipeline blockers)
- Technical debt (engineering input)
- Strategic initiatives (leadership goals)

#### Step 2: Score with RICE
```bash
# Input: CSV with features
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20
```

See `references/frameworks.md` for RICE formula and scoring guidelines.

#### Step 3: Analyze Portfolio
Review the tool output for:
- Quick wins vs big bets distribution
- Effort concentration (avoid all XL projects)
- Strategic alignment gaps

#### Step 4: Generate Roadmap
- Quarterly capacity allocation
- Dependency identification
- Stakeholder communication plan

#### Step 5: Validate Results
**Before finalizing the roadmap:**
- [ ] Compare top priorities against strategic goals
- [ ] Run sensitivity analysis (what if estimates are wrong by 2x?)
- [ ] Review with key stakeholders for blind spots
- [ ] Check for missing dependencies between features
- [ ] Validate effort estimates with engineering

#### Step 6: Execute and Iterate
- Share roadmap with team
- Track actual vs estimated effort
- Revisit priorities quarterly
- Update RICE inputs based on learnings

---

### Customer Discovery Process

```
Plan → Recruit → Interview → Analyze → Synthesize → Validate
```

#### Step 1: Plan Research
- Define research questions
- Identify target segments
- Create interview script (see `references/frameworks.md`)

#### Step 2: Recruit Participants
- 5-8 interviews per segment
- Mix of power users and churned users
- Incentivize appropriately

#### Step 3: Conduct Interviews
- Use semi-structured format
- Focus on problems, not solutions
- Record with permission
- Take minimal notes during interview

#### Step 4: Analyze Insights
```bash
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
```

Extracts:
- Pain points with severity
- Feature requests with priority
- Jobs to be done patterns
- Sentiment and key themes
- Notable quotes

#### Step 5: Synthesize Findings
- Group similar pain points across interviews
- Identify patterns (3+ mentions = pattern)
- Map to opportunity areas using Opportunity Solution Tree
- Prioritize opportunities by frequency and severity

#### Step 6: Validate Solutions
**Before building:**
- [ ] Create solution hypotheses (see `references/frameworks.md`)
- [ ] Test with low-fidelity prototypes
- [ ] Measure actual behavior vs stated preference
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Document learnings for future research

---

### PRD Development Process

```
Scope → Draft → Review → Refine → Approve → Track
```

#### Step 1: Choose Template
Select from `references/prd_templates.md`:

| Template | Use Case | Timeline |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Standard PRD | Complex features, cross-team | 6-8 weeks |
| One-Page PRD | Simple features, single team | 2-4 weeks |
| Feature Brief | Exploration phase | 1 week |
| Agile Epic | Sprint-based delivery | Ongoing |

#### Step 2: Draft Content
- Lead with problem statement
- Define success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state out-of-scope items
- Include wireframes or mockups

#### Step 3: Review Cycle
- Engineering: feasibility and effort
- Design: user experience gaps
- Sales: market validation
- Support: operational impact

#### Step 4: Refine Based on Feedback
- Address technical constraints
- Adjust scope to fit timeline
- Document trade-off decisions

#### Step 5: Approval and Kickoff
- Stakeholder sign-off
- Sprint planning integration
- Communication to broader team

#### Step 6: Track Execution
**After launch:**
- [ ] Compare actual metrics vs targets
- [ ] Conduct user feedback sessions
- [ ] Document what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Update estimation accuracy data
- [ ] Share learnings with team

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Description | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Solution-First** | Jumping to features before understanding problems | Start every PRD with problem statement |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Over-researching without shipping | Set time-boxes for research phases |
| **Feature Factory** | Shipping features without measuring impact | Define success metrics before building |
| **Ignoring Tech Debt** | Not allocating time for platform health | Reserve 20% capacity for maintenance |
| **Stakeholder Surprise** | Not communicating early and often | Weekly async updates, monthly demos |
| **Metric Theater** | Optimizing vanity metrics over real value | Tie metrics to user value delivered |

---

## Best Practices

**Writing Great PRDs:**
- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Include clear success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Use visuals (wireframes, flows, diagrams)
- Keep technical details in appendix
- Version control all changes

**Effective Prioritization:**
- Mix quick wins with strategic bets
- Consider opportunity cost of delays
- Account for dependencies between features
- Buffer 20% for unexpected work
- Revisit priorities quarterly
- Communicate decisions with context

**Customer Discovery:**
- Ask "why" five times to find root cause
- Focus on past behavior, not future intentions
- Avoid leading questions ("Wouldn't you love...")
- Interview in the user's natural environment
- Watch for emotional reactions (pain = opportunity)
- Validate qualitative with quantitative data

   - Comprehensive 11-section format
   - Best for major features
   - Includes technical specs

2. **One-Page PRD**
   - Concise format for quick alignment

   - Pre-PRD phase

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Framework
```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: # of users/quarter
Impact: 
  - Massive = 3x
  - High = 2x
  - Medium = 1x
  - Low = 0.5x
  - Minimal = 0.25x
Confidence:
  - High = 100%
  - Medium = 80%
  - Low = 50%
Effort: Person-months
```

### Value vs Effort Matrix
```
         Low Effort    High Effort
         
High     QUICK WINS    BIG BETS
Value    [Prioritize]   [Strategic]
         
Low      FILL-INS      TIME SINKS
Value    [Maybe]       [Avoid]
```

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope

## Discovery Frameworks

### Customer Interview Guide
```
1. Context Questions (5 min)
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Current workflow
   - Tools used

2. Problem Exploration (15 min)
   - Pain points
   - Frequency and impact
   - Current workarounds

3. Solution Validation (10 min)
   - Reaction to concepts
   - Value perception
   - Willingness to pay

4. Wrap-up (5 min)
   - Other thoughts
   - Referrals
   - Follow-up permission
```

### Hypothesis Template
```
We believe that [building this feature]
For [these users]
Will [achieve this outcome]
We'll know we're right when [metric]
```

### Opportunity Solution Tree
```
Outcome
├── Opportunity 1
│   ├── Solution A
│   └── Solution B
└── Opportunity 2
    ├── Solution C
    └── Solution D
```

## Metrics & Analytics
