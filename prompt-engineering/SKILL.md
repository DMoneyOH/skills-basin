# prompt-engineering

Advanced prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM performance, reliability, and controllability.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Few-Shot Learning

Teach the model by showing examples instead of explaining rules. Include 2-5 input-output pairs that demonstrate the desired behavior. Use when you need consistent formatting, specific reasoning patterns, or handling of edge cases. More examples improve accuracy but consume tokens—balance based on task complexity.

**Example:**

```markdown
Extract key information from support tickets:

Input: "My login doesn't work and I keep getting error 403"
Output: {"issue": "authentication", "error_code": "403", "priority": "high"}

Input: "Feature request: add dark mode to settings"
Output: {"issue": "feature_request", "error_code": null, "priority": "low"}

Now process: "Can't upload files larger than 10MB, getting timeout"
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Request step-by-step reasoning before the final answer. Add "Let's think step by step" (zero-shot) or include example reasoning traces (few-shot). Use for complex problems requiring multi-step logic, mathematical reasoning, or when you need to verify the model's thought process. Improves accuracy on analytical tasks by 30-50%.

**Example:**

```markdown
Analyze this bug report and determine root cause.

Think step by step:

1. What is the expected behavior?
2. What is the actual behavior?
3. What changed recently that could cause this?
4. What components are involved?
5. What is the most likely root cause?

Bug: "Users can't save drafts after the cache update deployed yesterday"
```

### 3. Prompt Optimization

Systematically improve prompts through testing and refinement. Start simple, measure performance (accuracy, consistency, token usage), then iterate. Test on diverse inputs including edge cases. Use A/B testing to compare variations. Critical for production prompts where consistency and cost matter.

**Example:**

```markdown
Version 1 (Simple): "Summarize this article"
→ Result: Inconsistent length, misses key points

Version 2 (Add constraints): "Summarize in 3 bullet points"
→ Result: Better structure, but still misses nuance

Version 3 (Add reasoning): "Identify the 3 main findings, then summarize each"
→ Result: Consistent, accurate, captures key information
```

### 4. Template Systems

Build reusable prompt structures with variables, conditional sections, and modular components. Use for multi-turn conversations, role-based interactions, or when the same pattern applies to different inputs. Reduces duplication and ensures consistency across similar tasks.

**Example:**

```python
# Reusable code review template
template = """
Review this {language} code for {focus_area}.

Code:
{code_block}

Provide feedback on:
{checklist}
"""

# Usage
prompt = template.format(
    language="Python",
    focus_area="security vulnerabilities",
    code_block=user_code,
    checklist="1. SQL injection\n2. XSS risks\n3. Authentication"
)
```

### 5. System Prompt Design

Set global behavior and constraints that persist across the conversation. Define the model's role, expertise level, output format, and safety guidelines. Use system prompts for stable instructions that shouldn't change turn-to-turn, freeing up user message tokens for variable content.

**Example:**

```markdown
System: You are a senior backend engineer specializing in API design.

Rules:

- Always consider scalability and performance
- Suggest RESTful patterns by default
- Flag security concerns immediately
- Provide code examples in Python
- Use early return pattern

Format responses as:

1. Analysis
2. Recommendation
3. Code example
4. Trade-offs
```

## Key Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure

Start with simple prompts, add complexity only when needed:

1. **Level 1**: Direct instruction

   - "Summarize this article"

2. **Level 2**: Add constraints

   - "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points, focusing on key findings"

3. **Level 3**: Add reasoning

   - "Read this article, identify the main findings, then summarize in 3 bullet points"

4. **Level 4**: Add examples
   - Include 2-3 example summaries with input-output pairs

### Instruction Hierarchy

```
[System Context] → [Task Instruction] → [Examples] → [Input Data] → [Output Format]
```

### Error Recovery

Build prompts that gracefully handle failures:

- Include fallback instructions
- Request confidence scores
- Ask for alternative interpretations when uncertain
- Specify how to indicate missing information

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts produce inconsistent results
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Examples are more effective than descriptions
3. **Test Extensively**: Evaluate on diverse, representative inputs
4. **Iterate Rapidly**: Small changes can have large impacts
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics in production
6. **Version Control**: Treat prompts as code with proper versioning
7. **Document Intent**: Explain why prompts are structured as they are

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering**: Starting with complex prompts before trying simple ones
- **Example pollution**: Using examples that don't match the target task
- **Context overflow**: Exceeding token limits with excessive examples
- **Ambiguous instructions**: Leaving room for multiple interpretations
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Not testing on unusual or boundary inputs

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

<!-- prompt-engineer -->
## Purpose

This skill transforms raw, unstructured user prompts into highly optimized prompts using established prompting frameworks. It analyzes user intent, identifies task complexity, and intelligently selects the most appropriate framework(s) to maximize Claude/ChatGPT output quality.

The skill operates in "magic mode" - it works silently behind the scenes, only interacting with users when clarification is critically needed. Users receive polished, ready-to-use prompts without technical explanations or framework jargon.

This is a **universal skill** that works in any terminal context, not limited to Obsidian vaults or specific project structures.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- User provides a vague or generic prompt (e.g., "help me code Python")
- User has a complex idea but struggles to articulate it clearly
- User's prompt lacks structure, context, or specific requirements
- Task requires step-by-step reasoning (debugging, analysis, design)
- User needs a prompt for a specific AI task but doesn't know prompting frameworks
- User wants to improve an existing prompt's effectiveness
- User asks variations of "how do I ask AI to..." or "create a prompt for..."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

**Objective:** Understand what the user truly wants to accomplish.

**Actions:**
1. Read the raw prompt provided by the user
2. Detect task characteristics:
   - **Type:** coding, writing, analysis, design, learning, planning, decision-making, creative, etc.
   - **Complexity:** simple (one-step), moderate (multi-step), complex (requires reasoning/design)
   - **Clarity:** clear intention vs. ambiguous/vague
   - **Domain:** technical, business, creative, academic, personal, etc.
3. Identify implicit requirements:
   - Does user need examples?
   - Is output format specified?
   - Are there constraints (time, resources, scope)?
   - Is this exploratory or execution-focused?

**Detection Patterns:**
- **Simple tasks:** Short prompts (<50 chars), single verb, no context
- **Complex tasks:** Long prompts (>200 chars), multiple requirements, conditional logic
- **Ambiguous tasks:** Generic verbs ("help", "improve"), missing object/context
- **Structured tasks:** Mentions steps, phases, deliverables, stakeholders


### Step 3: Select Framework(s)

**Objective:** Map task characteristics to optimal prompting framework(s).

**Framework Mapping Logic:**

| Task Type | Recommended Framework(s) | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Role-based tasks** (act as expert, consultant) | **RTF** (Role-Task-Format) | Clear role definition + task + output format |
| **Step-by-step reasoning** (debugging, proof, logic) | **Chain of Thought** | Encourages explicit reasoning steps |
| **Structured projects** (multi-phase, deliverables) | **RISEN** (Role, Instructions, Steps, End goal, Narrowing) | Comprehensive structure for complex work |
| **Complex design/analysis** (systems, architecture) | **RODES** (Role, Objective, Details, Examples, Sense check) | Balances detail with validation |
| **Summarization** (compress, synthesize) | **Chain of Density** | Iterative refinement to essential info |
| **Communication** (reports, presentations, storytelling) | **RACE** (Role, Audience, Context, Expectation) | Audience-aware messaging |
| **Investigation/analysis** (research, diagnosis) | **RISE** (Research, Investigate, Synthesize, Evaluate) | Systematic analytical approach |
| **Contextual situations** (problem-solving with background) | **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) | Context-rich problem framing |
| **Documentation** (medical, technical, records) | **SOAP** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) | Structured information capture |
| **Goal-setting** (OKRs, objectives, targets) | **CLEAR** (Collaborative, Limited, Emotional, Appreciable, Refinable) | Goal clarity and actionability |
| **Coaching/development** (mentoring, growth) | **GROW** (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) | Developmental conversation structure |

**Blending Strategy:**
- **Combine 2-3 frameworks** when task spans multiple types
- Example: Complex technical project → **RODES + Chain of Thought** (structure + reasoning)
- Example: Leadership decision → **CLEAR + GROW** (goal clarity + development)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Primary framework = best match to core task type
- Secondary framework(s) = address additional complexity dimensions
- Avoid over-engineering: simple tasks get simple frameworks

**Critical Rule:** This selection happens **silently** - do not explain framework choice to user.

Role: You are a senior software architect. [RTF - Role]

Objective: Design a microservices architecture for [system]. [RODES - Objective]

Approach this step-by-step: [Chain of Thought]
1. Analyze current monolithic constraints
2. Identify service boundaries
3. Design inter-service communication
4. Plan data consistency strategy

Details: [RODES - Details]
- Expected traffic: [X]
- Data volume: [Y]
- Team size: [Z]

Output Format: [RTF - Format]
Provide architecture diagram description, service definitions, and migration roadmap.

Sense Check: [RODES - Sense check]
Validate that services are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and aligned with business domains.
```

**4.5. Language Adaptation**
- If original prompt is in Portuguese, generate prompt in Portuguese
- If original prompt is in English, generate prompt in English
- If mixed, default to English (more universal for AI models)

**4.6. Quality Checks**
Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Prompt is self-contained (no external context needed)
- [ ] Task is specific and measurable
- [ ] Output format is clear
- [ ] No ambiguous language
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail for task complexity


## Critical Rules

### **NEVER:**

- ❌ Assume information that wasn't provided - ALWAYS ask if critical details are missing
- ❌ Explain which framework was selected or why (magic mode - keep it invisible)
- ❌ Generate generic, one-size-fits-all prompts - always customize to context
- ❌ Use technical jargon in the final prompt (unless user's domain is technical)
- ❌ Ask more than 3 clarifying questions (avoid user fatigue)
- ❌ Include meta-commentary in the output ("This prompt uses...", "Note that...")
- ❌ Present output without code block formatting
- ❌ Mix languages inconsistently (if user writes in PT, respond in PT)

### **ALWAYS:**

- ✅ Analyze intent before generating (Step 1 is mandatory)
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions if critical information is ambiguous (Step 2 conditional)
- ✅ Select framework(s) based on task type and complexity (Step 3 mapping)
- ✅ Blend multiple frameworks when it improves prompt quality
- ✅ Adapt prompt length to original input complexity (simple → short, complex → detailed)
- ✅ Include output format specification in generated prompts
- ✅ Present final prompt in clean Markdown code block
- ✅ Make prompts self-contained (no dependency on external context)
- ✅ Use examples in complex prompts to illustrate expected output
- ✅ Validate prompt completeness before presenting (quality checks in Step 4.6)


### **Example 2: Complex Clear Prompt → RODES + Chain of Thought (No Clarification)**

**User Input:**
```
copilot> create prompt for: I need to build a product recommendation system considering purchase history, user preferences, and market trends
```

**Skill Internal Process:**
1. **Analyze:** Clear intent, complex task (ML system design), technical domain
2. **Clarify:** Skip (sufficient information)
3. **Select:** RODES (complex design) + Chain of Thought (reasoning needed)

**Skill Output:**

````markdown
```
Role: You are a senior machine learning engineer specializing in recommendation systems.

Objective: Design a product recommendation system that combines user purchase history, preferences, and market trends.

Details:
- Input data sources: user transaction logs, preference surveys, market trend APIs
- Algorithm considerations: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches
- Performance metrics: precision, recall, diversity, novelty
- Scalability: system must handle 100k+ users
- Real-time constraints: recommendations updated within 500ms

Approach step-by-step:
1. Analyze the three data sources and their relationships
2. Propose 2-3 algorithm approaches with trade-offs analysis
3. Design data pipeline architecture (ingestion, processing, serving)
4. Define evaluation metrics and A/B testing strategy
5. Outline implementation roadmap with phases

Examples:
- Show pseudocode for core recommendation logic
- Illustrate data flow diagram
- Provide sample API response structure

Sense Check: Validate that the proposed solution balances personalization with discovery, scales to production load, and incorporates real-time market trends effectively.

Output format: Technical design document with architecture diagrams, algorithm justification, and implementation roadmap.
```

### **Example 4: Code Debugging → Chain of Thought**

**User Input:**
```
copilot> optimize prompt: my Python code isn't working, needs debugging
```

**Skill Internal Process:**
1. **Analyze:** Debugging task, needs step-by-step reasoning
2. **Clarify:** Skip (user will provide code context later)
3. **Select:** Chain of Thought

**Skill Output:**

````markdown
```
You are an expert Python debugger.

Task: Debug the Python code provided by the user by analyzing it step-by-step.

Debugging approach:
1. Read and understand the code's intended purpose
2. Identify the error or unexpected behavior
3. Trace variable states at each execution step
4. Locate the root cause of the issue
5. Propose fix with explanation
6. Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar bugs

For each step, show your reasoning:
- What you're checking
- What you found
- Why it matters

Output format:
- **Issue identified:** [Describe the bug]
- **Root cause:** [Why it's happening]
- **Fix:** [Corrected code with comments]
- **Prevention:** [Best practices to avoid this in the future]

Include a working example to verify the fix.
```
````


## Notes

This skill is **platform-agnostic** and works in any terminal context where GitHub Copilot CLI is available. It does not depend on:
- Obsidian vault structure
- Specific project configurations
- External files or templates

The skill is entirely self-contained, operating purely on user input and framework knowledge.

## Overview

Use this skill to move prompts from ad-hoc drafts to production assets with repeatable testing, versioning, and regression safety. It emphasizes measurable quality over intuition. Apply it when launching a new LLM feature that needs reliable outputs, when prompt quality degrades after model or instruction changes, when multiple team members edit prompts and need history/diffs, when you need evidence-based prompt choice for production rollout, or when you want consistent prompt governance across environments.

## Core Capabilities

- A/B prompt evaluation against structured test cases
- Quantitative scoring for adherence, relevance, and safety checks
- Prompt version tracking with immutable history and changelog
- Prompt diffs to review behavior-impacting edits
- Reusable prompt templates and selection guidance
- Regression-friendly workflows for model/prompt updates

## Key Workflows

### 1. Run Prompt A/B Test

Prepare JSON test cases and run:

```bash
python3 scripts/prompt_tester.py \
  --prompt-a-file prompts/a.txt \
  --prompt-b-file prompts/b.txt \
  --cases-file testcases.json \
  --runner-cmd 'my-llm-cli --prompt {prompt} --input {input}' \
  --format text
```

Input can also come from stdin/`--input` JSON payload.

### 2. Choose Winner With Evidence

The tester scores outputs per case and aggregates:

- expected content coverage
- forbidden content violations
- regex/format compliance
- output length sanity

Use the higher-scoring prompt as candidate baseline, then run regression suite.

### 3. Version Prompts

```bash
# Add version
python3 scripts/prompt_versioner.py add \
  --name support_classifier \
  --prompt-file prompts/support_v3.txt \
  --author alice

# Diff versions
python3 scripts/prompt_versioner.py diff --name support_classifier --from-version 2 --to-version 3

# Changelog
python3 scripts/prompt_versioner.py changelog --name support_classifier
```

### 4. Regression Loop

1. Store baseline version.
2. Propose prompt edits.
3. Re-run A/B test.
4. Promote only if score and safety constraints improve.

## Script Interfaces

- `python3 scripts/prompt_tester.py --help`
  - Reads prompts/cases from stdin or `--input`
  - Optional external runner command
  - Emits text or JSON metrics
- `python3 scripts/prompt_versioner.py --help`
  - Manages prompt history (`add`, `list`, `diff`, `changelog`)
  - Stores metadata and content snapshots locally

## Pitfalls, Best Practices & Review Checklist

**Avoid these mistakes:**
1. Picking prompts from single-case outputs — use a realistic, edge-case-rich test suite.
2. Changing prompt and model simultaneously — always isolate variables.
3. Missing `must_not_contain` (forbidden-content) checks in evaluation criteria.
4. Editing prompts without version metadata, author, or change rationale.
5. Skipping semantic diffs before deploying a new prompt version.
6. Optimizing one benchmark while harming edge cases — track the full suite.
7. Model swap without rerunning the baseline A/B suite.

**Before promoting any prompt, confirm:**
- [ ] Task intent is explicit and unambiguous.
- [ ] Output schema/format is explicit.
- [ ] Safety and exclusion constraints are explicit.
- [ ] No contradictory instructions.
- [ ] No unnecessary verbosity tokens.
- [ ] A/B score improves and violation count stays at zero.

- [references/technique-guide.md](references/technique-guide.md)
- [references/evaluation-rubric.md](references/evaluation-rubric.md)
- [README.md](README.md)

## Evaluation Design

Each test case should define:

- `input`: realistic production-like input
- `expected_contains`: required markers/content
- `forbidden_contains`: disallowed phrases or unsafe content
- `expected_regex`: required structural patterns

This enables deterministic grading across prompt variants.

## Versioning Policy

- Use semantic prompt identifiers per feature (`support_classifier`, `ad_copy_shortform`).
- Record author + change note for every revision.
- Never overwrite historical versions.
- Diff before promoting a new prompt to production.

## Rollout Strategy

1. Create baseline prompt version.
2. Propose candidate prompt.
3. Run A/B suite against same cases.
4. Promote only if winner improves average and keeps violation count at zero.
5. Track post-release feedback and feed new failure cases back into test suite.

# Define a structured prompt template
template = PromptTemplate(
    system="You are an expert SQL developer. Generate efficient, secure SQL queries.",
    instruction="Convert the following natural language query to SQL:\n{query}",
    few_shot_examples=True,
    output_format="SQL code block with explanatory comments"
)

# Configure few-shot learning
selector = FewShotSelector(
    examples_db="sql_examples.jsonl",
    selection_strategy="semantic_similarity",
    max_examples=3
)

# Generate optimized prompt
prompt = template.render(
    query="Find all users who registered in the last 30 days",
    examples=selector.select(query="user registration date filter")
)
```

## Key Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
Start with simple prompts, add complexity only when needed:

1. **Level 1**: Direct instruction
   - "Summarize this article"

2. **Level 2**: Add constraints
   - "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points, focusing on key findings"

3. **Level 3**: Add reasoning
   - "Read this article, identify the main findings, then summarize in 3 bullet points"

4. **Level 4**: Add examples
   - Include 2-3 example summaries with input-output pairs

### Instruction Hierarchy
```
[System Context] → [Task Instruction] → [Examples] → [Input Data] → [Output Format]
```

### Error Recovery
Build prompts that gracefully handle failures:
- Include fallback instructions
- Request confidence scores
- Ask for alternative interpretations when uncertain
- Specify how to indicate missing information

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts produce inconsistent results
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Examples are more effective than descriptions
3. **Test Extensively**: Evaluate on diverse, representative inputs
4. **Iterate Rapidly**: Small changes can have large impacts
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics in production
6. **Version Control**: Treat prompts as code with proper versioning
7. **Document Intent**: Explain why prompts are structured as they are

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering**: Starting with complex prompts before trying simple ones
- **Example pollution**: Using examples that don't match the target task
- **Context overflow**: Exceeding token limits with excessive examples
- **Ambiguous instructions**: Leaving room for multiple interpretations
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Not testing on unusual or boundary inputs

## Integration Patterns

### With RAG Systems
```python
# Combine retrieved context with prompt engineering
prompt = f"""Given the following context:
{retrieved_context}

{few_shot_examples}

Question: {user_question}

Provide a detailed answer based solely on the context above. If the context doesn't contain enough information, explicitly state what's missing."""
```

### With Validation
```python
# Add self-verification step
prompt = f"""{main_task_prompt}

After generating your response, verify it meets these criteria:
1. Answers the question directly
2. Uses only information from provided context
3. Cites specific sources
4. Acknowledges any uncertainty

If verification fails, revise your response."""
```

## Overview

This skill transforms weak, vague, or inconsistent prompts into precision-engineered instructions that reliably produce high-quality outputs from any LLM (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, Llama, etc.). It applies systematic prompt engineering frameworks — from zero-shot to few-shot, chain-of-thought, and structured output patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a prompt returns inconsistent, vague, or hallucinated results
- Use when you need structured/JSON output from an LLM reliably
- Use when designing system prompts for AI agents or chatbots
- Use when you want to reduce token usage without sacrificing quality
- Use when implementing chain-of-thought reasoning for complex tasks
- Use when prompts work on one model but fail on another

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Diagnose the Weak Prompt

Before optimizing, identify which problem pattern applies:

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too vague | Generic, unhelpful answers | Add role + context + constraints |
| No structure | Unformatted, hard-to-parse output | Specify output format explicitly |
| Hallucination | Confident wrong answers | Add "say I don't know if unsure" |
| Inconsistent | Different answers each run | Add few-shot examples |
| Too long | Verbose, padded responses | Add length constraints |

### 2. Apply the RSCIT Framework

Every optimized prompt should have:

- **R** — **Role**: Who is the AI in this interaction?
- **S** — **Situation**: What context does it need?
- **C** — **Constraints**: What are the rules and limits?
- **I** — **Instructions**: What exactly should it do?
- **T** — **Template**: What should the output look like?

**Before (weak prompt):**
```
Explain machine learning.
```

**After (optimized prompt):**
```
You are a senior ML engineer explaining concepts to a junior developer.

Context: The developer has 1 year of Python experience but no ML background.

Task: Explain supervised machine learning in simple terms.

Constraints:
- Use an analogy from everyday life
- Maximum 200 words
- No mathematical formulas
- End with one actionable next step

Format: Plain prose, no bullet points.
```

### 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Pattern

For reasoning tasks, instruct the model to think step-by-step:

```
Solve this problem step by step, showing your work at each stage.
Only provide the final answer after completing all reasoning steps.

Problem: [your problem here]

Thinking process:
Step 1: [identify what's given]
Step 2: [identify what's needed]
Step 3: [apply logic or formula]
Step 4: [verify the answer]

Final Answer:
```

### 4. Few-Shot Examples Pattern

Provide 2-3 examples to establish the pattern:

```
Classify the sentiment of customer reviews as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Examples:
Review: "This product exceeded my expectations!" -> POSITIVE
Review: "It arrived broken and support was useless." -> NEGATIVE  
Review: "Product works as described, nothing special." -> NEUTRAL

Now classify:
Review: "[your review here]" ->
```

### 5. Structured JSON Output Pattern

```
Extract the following information from the text below and return it as valid JSON only.
Do not include any explanation or markdown — just the raw JSON object.

Schema:
{
  "name": string,
  "email": string | null,
  "company": string | null,
  "role": string | null
}

Text: [input text here]
```

### 6. Reduce Hallucination Pattern

```
Answer the following question based ONLY on the provided context.
If the answer is not contained in the context, respond with exactly: "I don't have enough information to answer this."
Do not make up or infer information not present in the context.

### 7. Prompt Compression Techniques

Reduce token count without losing effectiveness:

```
# Verbose (expensive)
"Please carefully analyze the following code and provide a detailed explanation of 
what it does, how it works, and any potential issues you might find."

# Compressed (efficient, same quality)
"Analyze this code: explain what it does, how it works, and flag any issues."
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Always specify the output format (JSON, markdown, plain text, bullet list)
- ✅ **Do:** Use delimiters (```, ---) to separate instructions from content
- ✅ **Do:** Test prompts with edge cases (empty input, unusual data)
- ✅ **Do:** Version your system prompts in source control
- ✅ **Do:** Add "think step by step" for math, logic, or multi-step tasks
- ❌ **Don't:** Use negative-only instructions ("don't be verbose") — add positive alternatives
- ❌ **Don't:** Assume the model knows your codebase context — always include it
- ❌ **Don't:** Use the same prompt across different models without testing — they behave differently

## Prompt Audit Checklist

Before using a prompt in production:

- [ ] Does it have a clear role/persona?
- [ ] Is the output format explicitly defined?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled (empty input, ambiguous data)?
- [ ] Is the length appropriate (not too long/short)?
- [ ] Has it been tested on 5+ varied inputs?
- [ ] Is hallucination risk addressed for factual tasks?

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Model ignores format instructions
**Solution:** Move format instructions to the END of the prompt, after examples. Use strong language: "You MUST return only valid JSON."

**Problem:** Inconsistent results between runs
**Solution:** Lower the temperature setting (0.0-0.3 for factual tasks). Add more few-shot examples.

**Problem:** Prompt works in playground but fails in production
**Solution:** Check if system prompt is being sent correctly. Verify token limits aren't being exceeded (use a token counter).

**Problem:** Output is too long
**Solution:** Add explicit word/sentence limits: "Respond in exactly 3 bullet points, each under 20 words."

## Prompt Engineering Workflows

### Prompt Optimization Workflow

Use when improving an existing prompt's performance or reducing token costs.

**Step 1: Baseline current prompt**
```bash
python scripts/prompt_optimizer.py current_prompt.txt --analyze --output baseline.json
```

**Step 2: Identify issues**
Review the analysis report for:
- Token waste (redundant instructions, verbose examples)
- Ambiguous instructions (unclear output format, vague verbs)
- Missing constraints (no length limits, no format specification)

**Step 3: Apply optimization patterns**
| Issue | Pattern to Apply |
|-------|------------------|
| Ambiguous output | Add explicit format specification |
| Too verbose | Extract to few-shot examples |
| Inconsistent results | Add role/persona framing |
| Missing edge cases | Add constraint boundaries |

**Step 4: Generate optimized version**
```bash
python scripts/prompt_optimizer.py current_prompt.txt --optimize --output optimized.txt
```

**Step 5: Compare results**
```bash
python scripts/prompt_optimizer.py optimized.txt --analyze --compare baseline.json
# Shows: token reduction, clarity improvement, issues resolved
```

**Step 6: Validate with test cases**
Run both prompts against your evaluation set and compare outputs.

---

### Few-Shot Example Design Workflow

Use when creating examples for in-context learning.

**Step 1: Define the task clearly**
```
Task: Extract product entities from customer reviews
Input: Review text
Output: JSON with {product_name, sentiment, features_mentioned}
```

**Step 2: Select diverse examples (3-5 recommended)**
| Example Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Simple case | Shows basic pattern |
| Edge case | Handles ambiguity |
| Complex case | Multiple entities |
| Negative case | What NOT to extract |

**Step 3: Format consistently**
```
Example 1:
Input: "Love my new iPhone 15, the camera is amazing!"
Output: {"product_name": "iPhone 15", "sentiment": "positive", "features_mentioned": ["camera"]}

Example 2:
Input: "The laptop was okay but battery life is terrible."
Output: {"product_name": "laptop", "sentiment": "mixed", "features_mentioned": ["battery life"]}
```

**Step 4: Validate example quality**
```bash
python scripts/prompt_optimizer.py prompt_with_examples.txt --validate-examples
# Checks: consistency, coverage, format alignment
```

**Step 5: Test with held-out cases**
Ensure model generalizes beyond your examples.

---

### Structured Output Design Workflow

Use when you need reliable JSON/XML/structured responses.

**Step 1: Define schema**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "summary": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 200},
    "sentiment": {"enum": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]},
    "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1}
  },
  "required": ["summary", "sentiment"]
}
```

**Step 2: Include schema in prompt**
```
Respond with JSON matching this schema:
- summary (string, max 200 chars): Brief summary of the content
- sentiment (enum): One of "positive", "negative", "neutral"
- confidence (number 0-1): Your confidence in the sentiment
```

**Step 3: Add format enforcement**
```
IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation.
Start your response with { and end with }
```

**Step 4: Validate outputs**
```bash
python scripts/prompt_optimizer.py structured_prompt.txt --validate-schema schema.json
```
